\chapter{Testing}\label{ch:testing-of-the-implementation}
To test the effectiveness of the implemented policies from chapter~\ref{ch:implementation-of-the-solution}, a range of
tests are proposed in order to compare the solutions. These tests aim to compare the effectiveness of training
techniques, policy hyperparameters and to fixed heuristics. These tests fall into several distinct sections that are
explained in Table~\ref{tab:testing_areas}.

        Test Name & Explanation \\ \hline
        Multi vs Single environment training settings & There are huge ranges of possible environment settings that
            agents could be trained for. This test investigates how good single environment trained agents react to
            a new environment and how agents compare on an environment when an agent is only trained on that
            environment or on multiple environments. \\ \hline
        Multi vs Single agent environment training settings & As the Vickrey auction is incentive compatible then it is
            possible to train both the auction agents and resource allocation against itself. This test investigates
            the difference between the agent policies when self-trained or train with other agents. \\ \hline
        Reinforcement Learning Policy testing & As multiple different reinforcement learning policy outlined in
            table~\ref{tab:reinforcement_learning_policies}, this test compares the results of the different agents
            against each other. \\ \hline
        Fixed heuristic policies testing & In order to compare to the reinforcement learning policies, a number of
            fixed heuristic policies are investigated both against other heuristics and reinforcement learning
            policies. \\ \hline
