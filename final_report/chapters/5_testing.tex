\chapter{Testing}\label{ch:testing-of-the-implementation}
To test the effectiveness of the implemented policies from section~\ref{}, a range of tests are proposed in order to
compare the solutions. These tests aim to compare the effectiveness of training techniques, policy hyperparameters and
to fixed policies.

These tests fall into several distinct sections that are explained in Table~\ref{}.
