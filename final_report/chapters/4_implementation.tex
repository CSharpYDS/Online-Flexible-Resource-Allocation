\chapter{Implementation of the solution}\label{ch:implementation-of-the-solution}
Using the proposed solution in chapter~\ref{ch:proposed-solution-to-problem}, we can simulate edge cloud computing
environment and then train agents to bid on tasks and allocate resources. This has three sections to it, first the
simulation that is referred to as the environment (section~\ref{sec:simulating-the-environment}),
second to define the agents (section~\ref{sec:agent-definition}) and three to train the agents on the
environment (section~\ref{sec:training-of-agents}).

The implementation discussed below as written in Python and available to download on Github at

\section{Simulating the Environment}\label{sec:simulating-the-environment}
As the aim of the environment is to train agents to learn how to action optimally then the way that agents
interact with the environments matters. OpenAI~\cite{}, an independent research organisation, have create a large
number of open source popular reinforcement learning environment using the python module gym~\cite{}.
Due to the wide scale use and developing of agents to interact with environment using the OpenAI environment
specification, I have likewise programmed this environment to follow the same specification. %% todo this is a horrible sentence, to fix

\section{Agent definition}\label{sec:agent-definition}
There are two types of agents that need to be considered: task pricing agent and resource weighting agent that server
has one of each.
