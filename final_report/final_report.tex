\begin{abstract}
Edge clouds enable computational tasks to be completed at the edge of the network, without relying on access to remote
data centres. A key challenge in these settings is that server have limited computational resources often need to be
allocated to many self-interested users. Here, existing resource allocation approaches usually assume that tasks have
inelastic resource requirements (i.e., a fixed amount of compute time, bandwidth and storage), which may result in
inefficient resource use. In this paper, we expand previous work, that utilises an elastic resource requirement
mechanism, to an online setting such that job will arrive over time with the task prices and resource allocation
determined through agents trained using reinforcement learning.

\acknowledgements{
I want to thank my parents for all of the support they have given me because I would not be where I am now
without them. Also to my housemates for surviving with me pestering them about proof reading badly written papers and
for dealing with me stressing about this project.

This project wouldn't have started without Dr Sebastian Stein, Professor Tim Norman and a team of Pennsylvania State
University that has produced a paper investigating the static case of this problem. Thank to all of them for sharing
ideas and support for that paper and this project.

Also to Professor Tim Norman for this constant guidance over the project and the wisdom to know what for me
to investigate and implement.
